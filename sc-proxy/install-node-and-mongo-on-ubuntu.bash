# Install the latest official stable versions of Node and MongoDB from 
# their own repositories, not the older stuff in the Ubuntu repositories.

# Also installs the requirements for building node extensions (i.e. gcc).

# Finally installs the 'forever' npm package globally, because 
# our recommended start and stop scripts rely on it.

# Configures MongoDB to accept connections on localhost only - a safe default
# configuration. If you don't like this, you should explicitly configure MongoDB
# to allow connections from some safe set of IPs or to require authentication.
# MongoDB's default configuration is insecure.

# Assumes you have at least Ubuntu 10.04 (I haven't tested further back).

# npm is now part of the nodejs package, removed failing step to separately install it.
